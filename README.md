GEND.AR: Privacy-Preserving Gender-Inclusive In-Person Social Discovery Using Secure Multiparty Computation in Extended Reality

## Slogan

Envision a Flourishing Future of Privacy-Preserving Gender-Inclusive Encounters

## Abstract

In today's increasingly gender-diverse society, spontaneous social interactions present a unique challenge: distinguishing gender identity, expression, and sexual orientation from appearance alone is both unreliable and potentially disrespectful. This creates a coordination problem where directly inquiring about such personal attributes can be intrusive, while misgendering or making incorrect assumptions can lead to uncomfortable situations and damaged social connections.

We propose [GEND.AR](http://gend.ar/), a speculative extended reality application that addresses this social coordination challenge through privacy-preserving technology. The system enables users to discover compatible individuals in their immediate vicinity (10-20 meters) without compromising personal information. Using secure two-party computation protocols over Apple's MultipeerConnectivity framework, when two users are in proximity, [GEND.AR](http://gend.ar/) performs encrypted compatibility calculations without revealing individual preferences to anyoneâ€”including non-matching users and third parties. Upon detecting a mutual match, the extended reality interface discretely displays an animated visual indicator connecting the matched users. Non-matches receive no notification, thereby preserving privacy and preventing social awkwardness. To ensure authenticity and prevent misuse, the system integrates with proof of personhood protocols to prevent counterfeit profiles.

This design demonstrates how secure computation and extended reality can work together to facilitate authentic social connections while maintaining individual privacy and dignity in gender-inclusive spaces.
